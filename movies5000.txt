$1,000,000 Chance of a Lifetime|1986|A short-lived quiz show hosted by TV veteran Jim Lange. Husband-and-wife teams would compete against each other in answering a tough series of trivia questions. The winning couple would then go on to the championship round, where they would have a chance to win one million dollars. Two married couples, sometimes including a returning champion, competed in one of the first game shows to offer $1 million as a grand prize. In "$1,000,000 Chance of a Lifetime," which combined elements of "Wheel of Fortune" and "Scrabble," the couples competed to solve word puzzles. Up to six clues were given for the puzzle's solution; one member of each team was selected to try to guess each clue word, with letters inserted at random except for the last one. Each correct guess was worth $25 and allowed the contestant to go to the keyboard. The keyboard indicated which letters were in the puzzle, plus one "stinger" (an extra letter not in the puzzle); selecting the "stinger" meant the contestant lost his/her turn, and a new clue was played. Each selected letter revealed in the puzzle added $25 to the pot; the team that solves the puzzle won the pot. Three rounds were played, with the second round values of $50 per clue/puzzle letter and third round values of $100 each. The team with the most money after three rounds was champion, kept their winnings and advanced to the bonus round. In the bonus round, the couple selected a category from a choice of three and then are locked in an isolation booth. The couple has 60 seconds to guess six words associated with that category. For each successful bonus round win, the couple was given a cash prize ($5,000 on day 1, $10,000 on day 2), or they could give it back and continue, always at risk of losing a subsequent bonus round and thus having to leave the show. Only by winning three bonus rounds in a row did the couple win the $1 million grand prize. The $1 million was awarded as all cash during the spring 1986 season, and $900,000 plus a $100,000 luxury prize package (two Mazda cars, a house full of furniture, including a living room, dining room, bedroom, complete kitchen and outdoor spa, and twenty round-trip airline tickets to anywhere in America on Delta Air Lines) during the 1986-1987 season. 
$100,000 Name That Tune|1984|An updated version of the popular long-running quiz show, hosted by Jim Lange. Two contestants compete to see who has the greater knowledge of popular songs. As the music plays, the first contestant to name the song wins money and prizes. Additional challenges include the contestants 'bidding' on how few notes they need in order to name that tune. Two contestants competed in a series of musical identification games in this 1980s five-day-a-week update of "Name That Tune." Games included Melody Roulette, where host Lange spun a carnival wheel to determine the dollar value of the tune; Tune Topics, where each song's title was related; and the famous Bid-a-Note, where contestants were given the clue to a song and then bid downward against each other to determine how few notes they needed ("I can name that tune in three notes!"). Contestants won points for winning each round; the high scorer after three rounds was champion and moved on to the "Golden Medley. In the "Golden Medley," the champion had to identify seven tunes within 30 seconds. Prizes were awarded for each correct answer. An incorrect guess stopped the game, while naming all seven tunes won an additional prize package and the right to return for a tournament (which took place every eight weeks or so) for $100,000 in cash and prizes. Some of the prizes offered for the tournament winners were awarded individually to winners in a home- viewer contest.

'Allo 'Allo!|1982|RenÃ Artois runs a small cafÃ in France during World War II. He always seems to have his hands full: He's having affairs with most of his waitresses, he's keeping his wife happy, he's trying to please the German soldiers who frequent his cafÃ, and he's running a major underground operation for the Resistance. Quite often, the Germans' incompetence itself is what nearly lands RenÃ and his cohorts in hot water; they are not helped either by the locals, who are dreadfully keen to get rid of the Germans, but their blatant and theatrical attempts at espionage and secrecy often create problems that RenÃ must solve quickly. RenÃ Artois is the owner and manager of a cafÃ in German-occupied France of World War II. To look at him, it's hard to believe that some women find him irresistible, something he has to work hard to hide from his wife Edith. RenÃ's cafÃ, frequented by both the German military and the French resistance, is the focal point for the show. RenÃ's a bit of a coward and is stuck in the middle, trying to humor both sides. Hidden in the cafÃ are two English airmen who don't understand a word of French. Other characters include Lt. Gruber, a homosexual German tank driver; Otto Flick, the evil SS officer who is always outsmarted; and Engelbert von Smallhausen, his small sidekick. RenÃ's not the only coward in town: Captain Hans Geering and Colonel Kurt von Strohm are constantly on the defensive, along with Captain Alberto Bertorelli of the Italian army who has a medal for servicing Fiats. Much of the farce comes from Officer Crabtree, an British agent disguised as a French policeman with a poor grasp of "Zee Fronch Linguige," and from RenÃ's amorous waitresses, Mimi, Yvette, and Maria. In this spoof of World War II, RenÃ Artois runs a cafÃ in German-occupied France. He is also an unwilling agent of the Germans, mostly under the command of Col. Kurt von Strohm, and of the French Resistance, under the command of Michelle Dubois ("Listen very carefully; I shall say this only once"). RenÃ is married to aged Edith, who is the worst singer in the world, but he finds that young women find him sexy. Most of the plots include planning the murder of the local commanding German officer, General Erich von Klinkerhoffen, as well as the ownership of a painting called "The Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies"--a painting that everybody would love to get their hands on to sell after the war. He has also two downed idiot British airmen who, as time goes by, are impossible to get rid of. The main opposition is the insane SS officer Otto Flick. RenÃ tries to complete the German and the Fench Resistance's plans, even though he's a coward and wonders if he's going to get out of the war alive.

12 O'Clock High|1964|This series chronicles the adventures--in the air and on the ground--of the men of the 918th Bombardment Group of the U.S. Eighth Air Force. First commanded by irascible General Frank Savage--and later by Colonel Joe Gallagher, the son of a Pentagon General--the Group is stationed in England, and flies long-range bombing missions into German-held Europe. This story is based not-to-loosely upon the real experiences of the crew of Frenesi, captained by William "Pappy" Cely, flying out of Rougham Field, Bury St Andrews. Though the sketch in general is a composite of any B-17's crew at the time, there are unarguable parallels to the Frenesi story, specifically, the mission to Brunswick on 2/11/44. Cely and his crew flew an inordinate number of missions; more certainly than the required 25. Cely flew Frenesi and her crew on this critical mission to bomb a ball bearing factory in Brunswick this day. The formation received heavier than usual flak and suffered gravely. Upon approaching target, dense, but intermittent low fog made dispatch questionable and the SOP would have been let fly and high tail it, but Pappy opted for a go-round, and re-approach to minimize collaterals. There was a school, see. Well Frenesi took a lot of heat; she was very badly damaged, but she was rewarded with a break in the fog to allow her to precisely dispense her load. She rattled back to Rougham, held together by her skin alone; her structure being later deemed "the most heavily damaged bird to safely land". She was a miracle, and Cely a saint.

30 Days 'Til I'm Famous|2008|What is it to be a superstar? We suspect it's not at all what you think it is. All of us, at some time or another, come to a point our lives where we need to choose what path to go down. In many respects its like standing in front of a bridge - a bridge in life sort-of-speak. But if your goal in crossing that bridge is to become a superstar on the other side, you're going to find that in crossing it you're going to be on your own; that none of your friends are going to dare to go with you; and that when you get to the other side you're going to lose control and the only thing you will know, is that everything you know will do you no good from thereon. Everything on the other side of that bridge is new, and the choice is yours to make your world beautiful . . . or to make it crap. The choice is yours and yours alone. Our story follows the journeys of three different musical groups as they aspire to ascend toward superstardom. One of the groups is poor and living in the ghetto, and they are the victims of abusive relationships and broken families. Another group is a typical suburban garage band supported by friends and a family who loves them and cares about their dreams. The third group is filthy rich - and while it would seem the rich guys could simply buy their way to the top, the reality is that the one thing they want more than anything in life can not be bought. Now, while all of these groups of musicians come from vastly diverse backgrounds and have completely different motivations for wanting to become famous, underneath it all, they are all the same.... they just don't know it yet. All of them are going to cross the same bridge, and on the other side, all of them will face choices and all of them will have the opportunity to turn their new world into something beautiful . . . or to let it turn into crap. The choice is theirs, and theirs alone. We are going to find in our story that some people - no matter how talented they may be - simply do not deserve to be famous.

37 Days|2014|Three episodes of a docudrama that present the background to the First World War, since the assassination of Austro-Hungarian Archduke Franz Ferdinand to the declarations of war of various contenders. That means the thirty seven days elapsed between 28 June and 4 August 1914. The scenarios are the Foreign Office, the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, whose secretary was Sir Edward Grey series, and the German Chancellery in Berlin, so that the action is narrated by two young clerks who, after thirty-seven days, enlist in the armed forces . The miniseries is a mixture of drama and documentary, its tone is somewhat aseptically dry in which many details are simplified, but it highlights some aspects in order to answer the question that the viewer makes constantly: how we go from peace to war in just over a month? Though the series lop sides at a very British viewpoint and can't help to look at characters often caricatured, as Kaiser Wilhelm II, the Russian Tsar Nicholas II, the indecisive elderly Franz Joseph I, and the French Foreign Affairs Minister, Paul Cambon, it also balances a sense of levity avoiding to endorse the British character. Winston Churchill , First Lord of the Admiralty, the prime minister Herbert Asquith and David Lloyd George, Chancellor of the Exchequer or Treasury Minister, are not complimented. The series shows the struggle between pacifists and warmongers in the British Cabinet, as well as the growing opposition among military, led by Helmuth von Moltke, generalissimo of the German armies and civilian politicians, with Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg to the head. A dramatisation of the events that lead to World War 1, and, in particular, Britain's participation in the war. From the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand on 28 June 1914 until Britain declared war on Germany on 4 August 1914 - 37 days - we see the diplomatic negotiations and behind-the-scenes machinations from many sides.

3MW: Rivers of Blood|2008|Rivers of Blood is one of the best known but least understood speeches in British political history. In this documentary the fragments of filmed speech that survive are brought together and Enoch Powell's argument is examined in detail. Powell prophesied that mass migration would lead to segregation and communal violence, but the incendiary nature of his language dominated the headlines. His core argument was largely ignored. This film examines Powell's character and the fears that drove him to make his fateful speech. We see how his words bitterly divided the nation, and see why Powell was cast out into the political wilderness, with his speech becoming a byword for racism. On the 40th anniversary of Rivers of Blood, this film explores the controversial claims and counter-claims surrounding one of Britain's most divisive politicians, and perhaps the most infamous speech in modern political history. The interviewees include: Frank Field MP, Professor Stuart Hall, Lord Hattersley, Simon Heffer, Lord Heseltine, Lord Hurd, Lord Lester QC, Kenan Malik, Lord Parekh, Professor Roger Scruton, Ambalavaner Sivanandan and Baroness Lola Young. Contains some strong language. Further Information White Season (BBC) Related Documentaries A History of Britain

60 Seconds|2004|As the title suggests, 60 Seconds was a youth-orientated news programme, which summarised the days main news, sport and entertainment stories in a 60-second bulletin, with a countdown in the corner of the screen. There were six bulletins throughout the night, usually on the hour from 7:00pm until 12:00am, although occasionally the times would change depending on the channel schedule. The bulletins never went out later than 12:15am, and were always live. 60 Seconds started life on BBC Choice in July 2001, and was marketed as a news show aimed at Choice's target audience, young adults. It was presented in a colourful studio, with a soundtrack by the rave group Faithless. When BBC Choice was replaced by BBC Three in February 2003, 60 Seconds was one of the few shows to transfer to the new channel. It was given a revamp, with a more serious look that saw the Faithless soundtrack dropped. Instead of a large and colourful studio, the presenter now stood in a newsroom, with a screen behind them. In 2008, when BBC Three received a makeover, 60 Seconds did as well, now adapting a pink logo. Tasmin Lucia-Khan took over presenting duties, until 2010 when she left and was replaced by Sam Naz, who would become the longest-serving presenter.

Presenting the final episode, Sam Naz thanked viewers for their support of 60 Seconds before the bulletin ended with the message "RIP 60 Seconds - 2001-2016"

7de Laan|2000|Danie Odendaal, the producer and creator of 7de Laan, got the idea for this popular soap over 20 years ago. At the time he was still a resident of Melville who loved watching the people of his community over breakfast and a cup of coffee at his favorite coffee shop. Danie saw and experienced real people; while people have good characteristics they also have their faults. He gave his thoughts run free and began thinking about characters that he could fill his fictitious neighborhood and meeting place: a stingy businessman who walks around gossiping all day, someone with a heart of gold - who puts out fires and dries up everyone's tears - to manage his coffee shop, beautiful and sweet waitresses who also have a bit of drama and intrigue in their lives. And then a few eccentric residents like an old world gentleman with a weak heart who mixes up his sayings and idioms while he idolizes the Wise Solomon, and old matron with a military street who runs the old age home with an iron fist. And of course every soap must have a super bitch or two. And what about two rich, prim and proper snobbish ladies who constantly challenge each other but share a deep dark secret? En there has to be a young lady who always dreams of walking down the isle one day. Danie approached the then SABC with his idea for a soap, before there were any other soaps, but they felt they were no ready for such a program. Then when, 16 years ago, they approached him to see if he would develop a series for them, Danie dusted off the original idea and 7de Laan was born. Oppiekoffie's original name was Die Koffikan (The Coffee Pot) and that was also the working title of the new series. It was renamed "Hoe Meer Dae..." (How many days) but there was a feeling that it was too close to Days of Our Lives. Eventually, the title 7de Laan was chosen because it reflects a place where people live and work. And there is probably no town or city in South Africa that doesn't have a 7de Laan / 7th Avenue. It was also a name that is easy on the tongue and could be expressed beautifully from a graphics point-of-view. The series made its debut on Tuesday, 4 April 2000 on SABC 2. Initially the series was broadcast twice a week which then became five days a week - Monday to Friday with an omnibus on Sundays. The soap grew to the second most popular program in South Africa after Generations. In 2009 7de Laan boasted 1.95 million viewers per episode which translates to more than 70% of its target audience. "A place where everybody knows your name" - This, in a nutshell, describes the essence of Sewende Laan. Young and old, rich and poor, educated and uneducated - All live together in a fictional suburb in Johannesburg but it could easily be 'anywhere' in South Africa as it represents all cultures and communities. In short: A community that truly embodies the spirit of Ubuntu in the new South Africa.

For the next dozen years, recognition of Scotland as an independent country rested to a great extent with the Pope but recognition came, finally, in 1328. Robert the Bruce died on June 7, 1329.

A Twist in the Tale|1998|The Johnsons live in a small country town. Their dairy farm has been in the family for three generations, and although in recent years they have been struggling, Mike - the father of David (13) and Katie (10) - is not about to let it go without a fight. David has his own worries - he is being bullied at school by Wayne Brogan (14), the son of a rich neighboring farmer. Wayne is particularly scornful of David's push-bike, which is no match for Wayne's own all-singing, all-dancing version. On the day our story begins, Wayne chases David home from school, knocking him into a ditch and badly damaging the bike. Mike is as suspicious of Pat Brogan as David is of his son: for some years now Pat has been offering to buy up the Johnsons' farm. The chief money-spinner of the farm is their specialist cheeses: with the bank threatening to foreclose, despite the best efforts of the family's accountant Larry Sharpe, there could not be a worse time for the persistent and mystifying spoiling of the product. Mike is not beyond believing Pat Brogan to be somehow behind the contamination - and Nicky (19), the Johnsons' attractive dairy assistant, doesn't like him very much either... The night of David's crash, there is a huge thunderstorm over the farm. David cowers under the sheets - and therefore misses the most spectacular effect of the lightning... ... Until he wakes the next morning - the morning of Friday the 13th - to find a girl in his room he has never seen before - insisting that he is trespassing in her room. Jem Johnson - from the year 2098. Jem's father, back in the future, has designed a "compucator" - what Jem calls a commie. The commie is an astonishing invention: a kind of hand-held, intuitive supercomputer, which works by accessing the user's alpha waves and the universal matrix, the 21st century's version of the Internet. Jem has the prototype, and was being chased by a couple of what she calls "badlanders" for it when she crawled into her closet to come out in David's time. Jem is charming, brave, quick witted - and impulsive. After a number of near-misses with David's bewildered family, and unable to get back to her own time, she finally takes matters into her own hands and introduces herself to Mary, the children's mother. Katie, David's sister, is very keen on Jem, particularly when Jem reveals a fantastic common skill of the future: telepathy, for which Katie displays a definite flair. Strangest of all, when Jem takes herself to school, she makes a surprising conquest - Wayne Brogan. The only thing that worries responsible David are the two sinister men who seem to take as keen an interest in Jem as Wayne does... David is suspicious of Wayne's sudden transformation into Sir Galahad, and slightly jealous as well. When Jem's commie goes missing from her locker, he suspects Wayne has stolen it, despite Wayne's indignant denial - and when Jem goes missing next, he's certain of it. He and Mike have an angry confrontation with Pat and Wayne, but at midnight Jem is still not back. Unable to sleep with worry, David is startled by the appearance of Katie in his bedroom. The telepathy game the children played has had an unexpected outcome: Katie is receiving persistent images she is sure are from Jem - images of an office, a filing cabinet, a night street seen through a window. The children slip out of the house with only their dog Bones for company and set off to the rescue; they are joined by an unexpected friend and ally - the erstwhile bully Wayne. Jem's images lead the children to the main street of their little town, and into the offices of ... Larry Sharpe. But what can the family's sympathetic accountant have to do with the kidnapping of Jem? As Katie and Bones keep watch outside, Wayne and David begin the difficult task of breaking into Larry's inner office, where Jem is bound and gagged. Katie is horrified by the appearance of Larry and - of all people - Nicky, the Johnsons' dairy hand: what on earth are these two doing together? Leaping to her feet, Katie cannons into the fire exit door through which the children broke in - and to her horror it slams shut, locking her out and the two boys in. There follows a tense scene with Wayne and David in precarious hiding - but eavesdropping can sometimes be illuminating: it becomes clear not only that Larry and Nicky are behind the kidnap and the theft of the commie, but that they have long been in collusion over the jeopardizing of the farm's produce - the "accidental" spoiling of the cheeses - in order to force a sale - and force the Johnsons out. With the appearance of the two men David has observed watching Jem, the dastardly quadrangle is complete. Larry pays off the kidnappers and he and Nicky leave, gloating. With not only the farm but the secrets of the commie in their grasp, they will be very rich villains indeed. Katie and Bones sneak into the building as David and Wayne free Jem. With her telepathic powers she unlocks the combination dial of the safe and regains her commie ... and David makes a very important discovery: documents that clearly implicate Larry in the fraudulent handling of the business affairs of the farm. The children's gleeful laughter merges with the rumble of an approaching thunder storm... ... and we open again on David asleep ... and his calendar, clearly showing Friday the 13th, as Mary shakes him awake. David stumbles downstairs, bewildered: Jem is nowhere to be seen, and his inquiry about her meets with a blank response from Mary. But Mike and Mary certainly have enough to be distracted by - the morning mail brings the precious contract from Pacific Dairy Products they have been waiting for, and the paper the shocking news of the arrests of Larry Sharpe and Nicky. David is lost in thought, as the joyous dance of his parents mirrors the joyous dance of he and Jem the night before ... and Katie enters, bearing a puzzling object: the commie, which she has just found in David's room. David can only smile at her: it is something he has dreamed up, dreamed up for the future...

To supplement the President's discussions on policy, the camera shows viewers the economic hardships of a West Virginia mining town and takes them along on a diplomatic trip to Ethiopia. 
ABC Comedy News|1973|A sporadic series on ABC late night parodying the then-new phenomenon of happy talk news. Guest stars included many of the satirists of the day, including Mort Sahl and Richard Pryor. Show was produced on an irregular schedule and was reportedly loathed by the real ABC affiliate news teams who refused to provide intros because they felt (rightly) they were being mocked. Cast featured alumni of Second City and other improv comedy theaters. 
ABC Evening News|1953|From the 60's to the 90's, the three major networks were, for the most part, the only source for national and international news. ABC News, anchored by Peter Jennings, regularly presented viewers with both news briefs and in-depth coverage of top events, ranging from human interest stories to the numerous crises that occurred around the world.

ABC Rocks|1984|As the MTV cable network shocked the TV world with it's success as a 24-hour music video channel, the major broadcast networks soon tried to jump on the bandwagon to get their own share. ABC's entry in the fight was this program, which ran late on Friday nights and featured such popular cotemporary artists as Prince, John Cougar, The Cars, Huey Lewis and Cyndi Lauper. The program was not able to match MTV's success, however, and it lasted for only about a year. 
ABC Saturday Comedy Special|1976|Another summer comedy compilation show, this program featured pilots for shows that had not been selected as part of the 1978 fall season, reruns of shows from earlier seasons, and a set of comedy skits by comic veteran Harvey Korman. Also included in the mix was a live-action version of the Archie comic strip, highlighting the antics of the gang from Riverdale High. 
ABC Scope|1964|This long-running news show provided viewers with an in-depth look at the important political, economic and social issues facing the world. Rather than presenting the news in the standard format of being read by an anchor, this show featured one-on-one interviews with newsmakers, documentaries on various subjects, and round-table discussions between a group of experts. 
ABC Showcase|1950|Stareted when broadcast television was still in its infancy, this show presented viewers with a broad range of drama and variety productions, frequently featuring a comepletely different cast with each episode. Most of the titles shown were originally stage productions, with some of the classics, as well as a number of comedies, included in the mix.

ABC Television Players|1949|Prodced during the earliest days of television, this program was essentially a series of short stage plays performed in front of a camera. Filmed in Chicago and starring little-known local actors and actresses in half-hour dramas, this show lasted for just under a year, during which time it went through two name changes, being later known as "ABC Tele-Players" and "ABC Penthouse Players." 
ABC Weekend Specials|1977|A young poor boy comes across a leprechaun and rescues him. He is granted 3 wishes. He wastes the first two, so really ponders the third one, and eventually wishes for all the money in the world. We see money flying from all over the world into a gigantic stack. The boy goes and gets his friends to show off the money. They ask for some. He tries to give it to them, but it just flies right back into the stack. His friends get mad at him thinking he is being greedy. The president comes and tries to tell the boy that he must give the money back. He then tries to take it by force, but to no avail. The leprechaun is present telling everyone to give it up, the money stays with the boy. The president then tries to circumvent the wish by handing out Monopoly money and calling it real. The monopoly money then flies into the stack as well. The leprechaun explains that it doesn't matter if they change what money is, all money is the boy's. The boy is finally able to reverse the wish by rescuing the leprechaun again. This grants him one and only one wish this time, but at the expense of never seeing his friend the leprechaun again. 
ABC in Concert Country|1994|ABC started this Saturday night series as a complement to its "ABC in Concert" running on Friday nights.

These late-night concerts were also simultaneously broadcast on ABC radio. 
ABC's Nightlife|1964|Created in an effort to dislodge Johnny Carson from his position of dominance in the late-night television field, this show featured young Les Crane as entertainer, host and moderator. While the basic format of the show was very similar to The Tonight Show, it was set apart by Crane's spontenaity, lack of respect for the traditions of TV production and penchant for breaking the fourth wall, which presaged such later hosts as David Letterman. These antics, however, were unfortunately not appreciated by critics of the day, and the show went off the air after just one year.

AMA United States Motocross Nationals|1990|National Motocross Championships in the 125cc, 250cc and 500cc divisions. In the two years leading up to 1990 Jean-Michel Bayle served notice that he could win indoors or out, and on any sized bike. He won 125, 250 and 500 Nationals, as well as a handful of AMA Supercross mains, within the first calendar year of his U.S. campaign. So when he put a stop to embittered teammate Jeff Stanton's championship winning streak at two with a resounding AMA Supercross Championship, Stanton seemed to begrudge not only Bayle's seemingly effortless, natural ability, as well as his close friendship with Honda team manager Roger DeCoster. There was also an issue with the fans. This was the era of the first Gulf War, and the announcers in the AMA Supercross series fanned flames of resentment towards the foreigner by simply being over-the-top, pro-American in their race calls. JMB used the abrasive booing for motivation, and that made the fans boo him even more. Not a great moment for anyone, including Stanton and Bradshaw, both of whom seemed to get pulled into it simply because they were American heroes. Jean-Michel Bayle's takeover of American Motocross in 1991 was a shocker, but his motivation for the 1992 season was just as surprising. At about the same time JMB was getting the number one plates bolted onto his 1992 Honda CRs, he announced that he would quit motocross and supercross at the end of the season and embark on a road racing career for 1993. Even for the enigmatic Bayle, this was crazy! Indeed, JMB did not have the same motivation for dirt bike racing in 1992, while his Honda teammate Stanton showed up leaner, meaner and determined to get the titles he lost in '91 back. But both of them would soon have to take a back seat to Team Yamaha's Damon Bradshaw, who was coming of age in his third year in the 250 class. Bradshaw won five SX races in a row early in the '92 Camel Supercross campaign, while Stanton and Bayle were struggling on their new Hondas, which were totally revamped from the previous year's models. But Bradshaw crashed away his entire points lead at Indianapolis, and let the Honda boys back in the hunt. What followed was a nip-and-tuck battle for the supercross points lead between the three, with Bayle showing occasional, inspired glimpses of his '91 form, Bradshaw riding aggressively (which was good at times and bad at others) and Stanton staying in the hunt in his typical workman form.

Agon|1968|A powerful storm is raging in the dead of night, and a transport vehicle carrying uranium is forced to stop due to a landslide blocking off the road on the mountain pass they were traveling on. As the driver tried to contact the transport's headquarters, a second landslide from the heavy rain comes crashing down onto the vehicle, sending it over the edge of a cliff and into the sea below. The storm is the result of an intense typhoon striking Japan, leaving hundreds dead and several hundreds more without homes. Reports from the survivors begin to pour in to the City News Division, leaving every reporter on staff manning the phones to take down any new information regarding the storm. One reporter, Goro Ryouji, nicknamed the "Suppon", arrives late, much to the anger of his boss, but he reveals that he's following up on the transport vehicle's crash. He also lets his boss know that the news division's competitors don't know about this yet, so Goro has an exclusive scoop at the time. The next day, the National Atomic Energy Center and the police have begun to investigate the area near where the vehicle went off the edge. Detective Yamato arrives to ask Dr. Ukyo if there have been any readings of radioactivity, to which the doctor nods and wonders if the vehicle was completely washed to sea. Goro soon arrives, revealing his information on both Yamato and Ukyo before revealing that he knows about the special uranium that it was containing, Uran X. As the three talk, they begin to hear strange roaring noises near the mountainside, which one of the police officers refers to as the "Tengu's Great Trumpet Shell", a large cave that funnels air in such a way to produce the sound. Goro rushes into the cave to explore it, only to run back out in a panic exclaiming that something has appeared. A strange light appears from the tunnel, which Goro says was a one-eyed monster, but as the four look on in fear, the light goes out, and a young boy with a flashlight, Monta, comes out of the cave. Yamato asks where Monta found the flashlight, and after some coaxing, it is revealed that it was from the transport vehicle and that he found it amongst the rocks. Goro and the others suddenly begin to hear a loud noise behind them, likewise noticing that one of the Geiger counters pointed out towards the ocean is reading levels off the scale. As they look out towards the ocean, a large, reptilian creature slowly breaches the surface. The next day, news of the creature begins sweeping the news, and Goro and Yamato, on their way to the Atomic Research Center to see Dr. Ukyo, begin to wonder why the monster has decided to appear now. As they're making their way towards the center, they are forced to stop when a dog sitting on the road refuses to move out of the way. Goro tries to coax the dog off to the side when a young woman appears and tells Goro that the dog won't let them pass because it has the common sense to know that smoking isn't allowed at the center. Once Goro puts out his cigarette, the dog walks off to the side of the road, and Yamato, joking that Goro lost, drives on, leaving the reporter to chase after him on foot. Dr. Ukyo arrives and begins to tell him that he has information regarding Agon, the name he has given to the monster. He reveals that it is a mutated dinosaur from the Jurassic period. Believing it to have been dormant under the ocean, Ukyo suggests that the mutation is a result of nuclear bomb tests in the Pacific. The woman from the road, Satsuki Shizukawa, appears, and Dr. Ukyo reveals that she is his research assistant. Just then, she receives a phone call reporting that the center's uranium storage checking meter is showing an abnormality. With no issues with the uranium fuel, Goro, Yamato, Dr. Ukyo, Satsuki, and several other scientists make their way towards the beach and begin to pick up high radioactive readings. Dr. Ukyo sends Satsuki to return to the center to alert the authorities, but as Agon appears and begins to tear through the forest, Satsuki falls and her leg gets pinned under a tree. As Goro and the others reach the Research Center to begin to evacuate the facility, he realizes that Satsuki hasn't arrived. Satsuki tries desperately to pull her leg free from under the tree, but as Agon approaches, the weight of the creature opens up a large fissure in the ground, and the ground underneath her gives way, causing the scientist to fall down into it.

Agoro the Phobic Monster|2016|This is a show for the internet. It's an absurd reflection of the way you live when your not online - without being pre-occupied with social media. If we have to get all academic about it the show is a satirical examination of 'cocooning culture' and 'the mutilation of social gooditude' - i.e. Shut-Ins and the wonderful world of spending too much time inside. Conceptually the show is 'muppets in the modern age', we don't mean 'brightly coloured, singing things in a modern setting', what we're talking about is the answer to the question: 'what if the concept was invented today by independent filmmakers?' The series itself draws from the aesthetic of 'The Muppets', the format of 'Strongbad Emails' and the premise of 'ALF' while borrowing from the comedic tone of 'Regular Show', 'The Simpsons' and 'South Park' - among several dozen other inspirational movies, TV shows and comics that no-one in our core target demographic has heard of, or remembers... which will make you think our ideas are fresh and original.

Agronsky & Co.|1976|The show origins were with a show titled Martin Agronsky: Evening Edition on a local PBS affiliate in Washington, WETA, in 1971 The re-titled showed went national in 1976 on PBS affiliates and syndicated by the shows producer, the Post-Newsweek company. The host Martin Agronsky was a distinguished journalist who gained national prominence as the host of the long running CBS interview show "Face the Nation". At the time, Face the Nation used the dominant format for the network Sunday morning interview shows. Similar to a press conference, a prominent figure in politics or the news would be interviewed by a panel of reporters and journalists. Each panelist would ask their questions in turn, with no interaction with each other. In contrast, the Agronsky show popularized the "Journalist Round Table Discussion" format used by other more well more known shows, such as the McLaughlin Group and PPS's Washington Week in Review. Each week, a group of noted journalists engaged in a free wheeling discussion on a wide range of hot button issues moderated by Agronsky. Many other news show, notably ABC's This Week David Brinkley began incorporating the format into segments of the show. Agronsky & Co is most often compared to the McLaughlin Group. However, the style of the hosts could not be more different. Where Martin Agronsky was a calming influence on the sometimes heated discussions, John McGlaughlin is known to raise the decibel levels and stir things up. Several of the Agronksy regulars moved on to those shows, most notably columnist and author George Will. Other prominent regulars on the show included Time Magazine editor Hugh Sidey and journalists Elizabeth Drew, Carl Rowan and James J. Kilpratrick. Kilpatrick gained fame in the 1970s for his contentious commentary in 60 minutes "Point-Counter Point" segment". Rowan was a pioneering black journalist. Although tame by today's standard, the contentious exchanges between the very conservative and Kilpatrick and very liberal Rowen foreshadowed a style of discussion that some call "food fight" TV. With Agronsky & Co., Drew and Will provided more calmed reasoning from the left and right, with Sidey appearing to be the quintessential moderate. After the show ended in 1987, several of the cast members, including Drew and Sidey participated in a show distributed by the same producer that could be considered a successor series. However, it never gained the prominence of the ground breaking Agronsky & Co. Martin Agronsky passed away in 1999.

The story begins in World War One with the death-defying exploits of four bold young airmen-Norman Brearley, Charles Kingsford Smith, Wilmot Hudson Fysh and Paul McGinness-who would go on to establish Australia's first airlines. Encouraged by Prime Minister Billy Hughes, they were among the brave and stubborn men responsible for conquering the tyranny of distance, within our vast continent and between it and Europe. They faced difficult, often dangerous conditions-marred at the start by accidents and fatalities, but highlighted by ground-breaking, headline-grabbing flights. Behind the scenes, however, battles were fought in boardrooms and with backers and bureaucrats to keep the airlines aloft. Gradually, businessmen replaced aviators at the helm of the companies, and take-overs rather than take-offs became front-page news. In an era of corporate giants like Sir Reginald Ansett, Sir Peter Abeles, Robert Holmes a Court and Rupert Murdoch, the stakes climbed even higher... Air Australia revisits this grand but turbulent history.

Alchemy|1998|Australia's first television program focusing on dance and electronic music. This late-night show quickly became a cult phenomenon after interviews with Australian artists The Avalanches, Pnau, Infusion, B(ift)ek and internationals Bjork, The Chemical Brothers, Run DMC, Fatboy Slim, Underworld and Carl Cox. The show was a follow-on from the world music and hip hop-focused radio program Alchemy on SBS Radio established by Frank Rodi, but became more interested in the contemporary movements of all electronic music, extending to House, Techno, Drum 'n' Bass with a genuine interest in ambient electronica and IDM. The hour-long, weekly show had an interesting structure being hosted in the studio by three VJ/presenters: Frank Rodi (of SBS Radio), Robbie Buck (then of ABC Radio Triple J) and Nicole Fossati (a music promoter and occasional ABC Radio DJ). The shows had a mix of video clips, music charts and interviews with the artists along with a section titled the 'Scrapbook' which explored a more documentary approach to those with obsessive tendencies in collecting or producing music. Two special hour-long episodes were dedicated to German Electronica and also to the UK artist Aphex Twin. The show took an experimental and exploratory approach to its format, playing with the self-referential (edits were occasionally punctuated with a graphic reading "edit"; text read via a teleprompter was overlaid in mirror over the footage of the presenter reading it; interviews were intercut and remixed into the music played by the artist), many dance floor tracks which did not yet have a video clip had clips produced in-house on a weekly basis and interviews were often held in strange or outrightly stupid locations and environments (David Thrussell was interviewed by Rodi whilst swimming in the infamous overhanging lap pool of the Adelphi Hotel in Melbourne; other interviews were held via security camera, in moving vehicles or shot on a stills camera and re-filmed off a slide projector). This interest in the visual side of music culture extended to being the first music show in Australia to credit the director of the video clip alongside the music producer and record company.

In also has the paramedic team of Bron and Ben. All Saints is an exciting drama series centred around a busy hospital, with an unusual spin on the highly successful genre of hospital drama. Because All Saints focuses on the lives of the people who carry most of the responsibility, the nurses manly, not the doctors, this show delivers stories from the frontline. The nursing staff in All Saints are closer to their patients than anyone else night and day. They are often forced to make crucial decisions, but don't have the power or authority of the doctors. From their point of view, we get to know the patients stories as well as those of the main characters, through the close relationships and bonds that develop when lives are on the line. The men and women on the nursing staff not only work hard, they play hard too. They're not always saints some days they are cranky, disillusioned, angry or frustrated. The strength and appeal of the series lies in its focus on a group of diverse characters who are instantly easy to relate to: we share their friendships and their relationships. Humour is crucial in such an intense environment, and the overall atmosphere of the series is warm and upbeat, with a strong feel-good factor. Interwoven with the frenetic pace and high-octane drama of life on a hospital ward are the more personal stories of a hugely compelling cast of characters who will be instantly engaging to viewers all over the world. This Australian medical drama focuses on the working lives and personal lives of the doctors and nurses of Ward 17 at All Saints hospital. Head nurse Terri Sullivan is an ex-nun who oversees life in Ward 17, while trying to work professionally with ex-lover Dr. Mitch Stephens.

All Star Blitz|1985|"All-Star Blitz" was the last in a long-line of multi-celebrity games associated with game show producer Merrill Heatter, all which had in some way to do with his by far most successful effort, "The Hollywood Squares." In "All-Star Blitz" (incidentally hosted by "The Hollywood Squares" host Peter Marshall) two contestants, including a returning champion, competed with the help of four celebrities. Behind the celebrities' podiums was a wall of six electronic screens, which contained the words to a familiar phrase. The basic rules were similar to "The Hollywood Squares" (e.g., choose a celebrity, agree or disagree), but with the following changes: 1. When the contestant chose a celebrity, he/she also picked a star in in his/her column to light (i.e., "so-and-so at the bottom"); 2. The celebrity is asked a multiple-choice answer, and generally did not bluff; and 3. If the contestant was correct, he/she continued control of the board, but if not, control passed to the opponent. Whenever four stars around a screen were lit, that screen exposes part of the phrase. At any time, the contestant in control of the board may guess the phrase, always at the risk of losing control if incorrect. The first contestant to solve two puzzles won a prize package worth approximately $4,000 and advanced to the Blitz Bonanza Board. In The Blitz Bonanza, the object was for the contestant to solve one more word puzzle; by spinning a wheel, the contestant could highlight and reveal portions of the puzzle. Up to four spins were allowed, though spins could prove to be unhelpful if they designated an already-highlighted screen. If fewer than four screens were lit, the contestant could either solve the puzzle or trade the prize package already won in the front game (all previous winnings were considered safe) for one more spin. Following the fifth spin, the contestant has 10 seconds to review the puzzle; at the same time, the celebrities write down their guesses as to the correct phrase. At any time during the Blitz Bonanza, a correct guess was worth $10,000 (plus an additional $5,000 for each day not won, up to a maximum $25,000); an incorrect guess at any time stopped the Blitz Bonanza, though he/she could collect $250 per celebrity who guessed the puzzle correctly. Contestants competed until defeated or winning five games, at which point they also won a new car.

At this time people sung folksongs, ballads and songs with patriotic spirit. He was followed by Egon Kjerrman (host: 1956 - 1966) who changed the repertoire towards temporary evergreens. After 10 years he left without a successor. His motto was: -'I sing rather than good' But in 1974, it was time again. This time with Bosse Larsson (host: 1974 - 1993) and still on the radio.

Each episode of America in Primetime focuses on one character archetype that has remained a staple of primetime through the generations - the Man of the House, the Independent Woman, the Misfit, and the Crusader - capturing both the continuity of the character, and the evolution.

Their challenge is to produce two segments for a new children's show. One of the two segments must be a musical. The contestants have to pick a team leader. They all decided that Daniel will be their leader, so he divides the team in half. Zo, Schliz, and Gwen will work on the musical segment. Jessica, Evie, and Adam will work on the scripted segment. The next day, the remaining seven headed off to elimination. The musical segment was about making friends. The judges thought that they executed it. They liked the scene and how it led up to the song. They also liked the turtle's name Shellby and the lyrics to the song. The other segment was about protecting the environment and recycling. Daniel was asked if he got hired, and had a budget, to take six people but who would he not take. Daniel picked Gwen since she did not help him on the pitch. Schliz was asked the same question, and he picked Gwen as well. Gwen had to pick a person as well, and she chose Daniel. Zo picked Evie since he has had problems with her. Jessica picked Daniel. Unexpectedly, Evie picked Zo to go home. Adam refused to answer the question, but when he was forced to pick someone, he chose everyone to go instead of him to go home (that was his way to avoid the question). The contestants were then excused from the room, while the judges picked which one should go home. The seven remaining contestants were brought back into the room. Jessica was the winner, since it was her idea for the scripted segment and for the name she gave the turtle. Zo was saved for writing the song. Evie and Schliz were also saved. Daniel was saved, which left Gwen or Adam to be eliminated. Adam was eliminate since he could not deliver a answer right away. And because the judges could only see him as a writer and not a producer.

The series boasts unique access to the Warhol Foundation's rich and extensive archives, previously unseen private home-movie footage, audio-tapes as yet unheard, and extracts from Warhol's legendary film experiments, mysteriously withdrawn by the artist over 30 years ago. Warhol's intuitive grasp of, and influence on, the collapsing of high and low culture in the late twentieth century is reflected in the extraordinary range of participants in this series, who include ARTHUR DANTO, Professor of Philosophy at Columbia University, Blondie's DEBBIE HARRY, Hollywood maverick DENNIS HOPPER and fellow Warhol collector LORD ARCHER.

Beginning with Warhol's death and the establishment of the Andy Warhol museum in Pittsburgh (the only museum dedicated to an American artist), it becomes immediately apparent as we sift through the vast treasure of archives that whether Warhol was sketching, painting, screen printing, photographing, filming, writing, publishing, tape recording, videotaping, or speaking on the telephone, that his entire life was his work, and that as an artist he was obsessed with documenting experience.

As for Me & My House|2008|A television sit-com about a blended Houston family coping with life after Hurricane Katrina, "As For Me and My House" follows the lives of single-parent sisters, Nicole and Michelle, and all their children. A modern take on the old 'Odd Couple' series from the 1970s, Nicole is a mid-30s attorney in Houston pursuing the position of partner with her law firm. At first glance, she seems to have it all together. She has the house, the car and two (2) kids in private school. But she raises them on 'happy meals' and 'blockbuster nights' because of her hectic work and socializing schedule. Her younger sister, Michelle, is a street-savvy hairstylist in New Orleans with three (3) children, all from different fathers. The irony is that, though her personal life decisions have been suspect since high school, Michelle's parenting skills far outweigh those of Nicole; as she is more hip and understands the latest teenage lingo, and is also a "tough love" disciplinarian. She also wields an uncanny respect (Nicole calls it fear) from her children often by shooting them that ever familiar mother's "look." When Hurricane Katrina claims Michelle's home, she does the obvious: With her kids in tow, she packs up her pressing combs, her tarot cards and her gumbo pot and makes the trek to H-town to move in with Nicole and her suburban family. Now both women must check their attitudes at the door and blend their differences of opinion, educational levels and authoritative styles into a flavorful, yet spicy blend of cultural gumbo. "As For Me and My House"... this ain't the Brady Bunch!

Asaab Qarar: The Most Difficult Decision|2008|In the world of organ transplants there is often overlapping and conflicting relationships, much like a love triangle, where there is one donor with the need organs and two very sick people to whom that organ may mean life and death, and, as it goes in a love triangle, where both people contend for the loved one's affection, so it is in the selection for an organ transplant, someone wins and someone loses. This is that story. The donor is Matt Mason, but his story lives on in the struggles of his pregnant wife, mother and father as they work through their loss and face their fears and aversion to organ transplant. The recipients are on total opposite ends of spectrum, Lucy is a young and vibrant college student with her life before her, who fears she'll not have time to live life and is making all the wrong choices in pursuit of experiencing all she can. Her Papa and Mama are caught in a never ending circle of trying to protect Lucy from her disease and from herself. Tony, on the other hand, was living life to its fullest with a wonderful wife, family and job, but a freak auto accident took it all away. Now he finds way to punish himself for living, much to the dismay of his home care nurse, Gene, who has fallen hopelessly in love with Tony-so much so that she will risk her license and risk rejection from Tony by using her connection with hospital heads to move him to the top of the Organ Recipient List. And then there are those who make the choices, the Transplant Team, who must not only determine who moves to the top of the list, but who, in a world of not enough donors, must also console and convince families to donate the organs of someone they love and have just lost. This is the story of the heartache and loss, the anxiety and pain, the desperation and duplicity that arise in the drama of organ transplants. The difference is that the viewers will decide who moves to the top of the list.

Meanwhile, in space, Greenbeard's ship has fallen apart whilst in the middle of stealing jewels from the planet Pacula. Greenbeard demands to find a new ship, and arrives on Earth at the theme park. As Betty and her family settle in on going into a waterslide with a pirate ship, Greenbeard also sets his sights on it to use as his new ship. Seeing Greenbeard, Betty attempts to corral her parents to safety, but Betty's parents believe Greenbeard and his crew are park employees putting on a show. As Betty retreats to find Sparky, Greenbeard takes Betty's parents hostage after hearing about Betty's mother's snacks, which were termed "gold bars". Taking the ship and Betty's parents with them, Greenbeard leaves Earth for Pacula to make another attempt at the jewels. After refusing to hand over the "gold bars", Greenbeard attempts to keelhaul Betty's parents, but they are saved by Sparky, who had been on the ride when Greenbeard had hijacked the ship. Betty, her parents, and Sparky return to the deck of the ship just as Greenbeard discovers that there are too many jewels to steal, and the ship cannot hold them all. After an explosion occurs on the ship caused by having too many jewels, Greenbeard attempts to steal the "gold bars" again as a consolation prize, but he and his crew are quickly dispatched by Betty, her parents, and Sparky (Betty's father taking photos as the other three were doing the fighting). However, they are unable to control the ship, as it drifts at high speed towards Earth. However, thanks to X-5's invention (a motorized pinwheel), the ship is able to reenter Earth's atmosphere safely, and the ship lands back at the amusement park. Rodeo Robots: Betty and her crew is with her uncle Charlie, where they are enjoying the Moose Jaw Heights Rodeo.

Back at the rodeo, Admiral DeGill, also at the rodeo, gets word of Robo-Betty's abduction and orders Betty to stop Cerebral. While distracted by Chaz, Betty and X-5 are discovered by Cerebral. As Betty escapes Cerebral's gunfire, X-5 tries to confront Robo-Betty, only to be kicked onto Sparky, still riding Thunderbolt. X-5 manages to tame Thunderbolt, and the two of them together return to assist Betty. Meanwhile, while Robo-Betty has a temporary malfunction after she meets Chaz, Betty has gained the upper hand on Cerebral. However, this would not last: as Cerebral accidentally throws out a rubber snake that he had won from inadvertently being knocked into a carnival game, it spooks Sparky and X-5 off Thunderbolt, knocking the two on Betty and allowing Robo-Betty to tie the three up. Strapping Betty and her crew on a rocket-powered steer, Cerebral and Robo-Betty celebrate their victory in front of a grandstand full of fans just as B-1 arrives from Crushton. B-1 manages to use a tow line to stop the steer, but Robo-Betty manages to knock B-1 out of his cruiser. B-1 confronts Robo-Betty directly, causing Cerebral's remote control to wear off. Robo-Betty destroys the remote control herself, just as Betty and her crew free themselves, with Thunderbolt's assistance. Cerebral is chased off Earth by his rocket steer, while B-1 and Robo-Betty take their leave.

Az emberi kaland|2001|The basic idea of the film: This world has not been tailor-made for us. We are not "at home". We live in a world, which is according to Jacques Monod "an alien world", a world which is "deaf to our music, just as indifferent to our hopes as it is to our suffering or our crimes". Within this alien world, in this vast and cold and dark universe, we have built, and keep building day by day, our own human world of dignity, freedom, security and happiness. Deliberately or unintentionally, in or without awareness, we construct (and demolish) this world every moment, including the most trivial acts of our lives. How? That is what the series will show. First episode: Are we at home in this Universe? Is our Planet an Earthly Paradise? Or a killing field? Why do certain animals die so early? Will butterflies, cockroaches and dolphins survive us? How did we convince ourselves that we were at the center of the world? Homo sapiens and the human adventure.

BBC Newsline|1996|THE ROAD TO NEWSLINE: The coming of BBC TV to Northern Ireland was via a small transmitter in an old nissen hut which was installed so that good folk of Northern Ireland could watch the Coronation in 1953. The first regular news magazine for BBC viewers in Northern Ireland was 'Ulster Mirror' which started on 26th November 1954. It was a fortnightly programme of events filmed in Northern Ireland but rarely would have included what we would refer to as hard news. Although the material was filmed here BBC Northern Ireland had no processing facilities so the exposed film had to be carefully packed and transported to the BBC processors in London where it was also edited before being sent back to Ulster in a 'ready to show' state. It was not until 30th September 1957 that BBC Northern Ireland had its first local TV news when it's first presenter was Maurice Shillington. Even then there were still no facilities for film and the only illustration would have been an occasional black and white still photograph. The first news type magazine programme hit then quite small screens on 20th February 1959 when Robert Coulter introduced the very first edition of 'Studio Eight' the snappy title of a news programme direct from the BBC Studio 8 in Belfast. Studio 8 was a remarkably small studio but the hardware, particularly the cameras, in the late 50s were huge and production of programmes from such a small area became a triumph of ingenuity over adversity. Some four years later the Beatles broadcast from the same studio. Over the next few years the programme title changed, first to "Six O'Clock" then to "Six-Five" with Michael Baguely as presenter and then to "Six-Ten". Perhaps having a title that would attract people was not such a priority in the days when there was just the one channel to watch and, sure enough, everyone did watch. In 1969 the more sophisticated "Scene Around Six" came on air and remained with us for thirteen years. This programme made household names of people like Wendy Austin, Barry Cowan and Sean Rafferty and, in spite of great difficulties and danger to camera and crews, never failed to bring on the spot film reports from every corner of Northern Ireland during the worst of the troubles. Older viewers will remember the Scene Around Six presenter always handed over to 'Nationwide' in London for the national news programme. In 1982 a remodelled news magazine programme with a sharper news edge called 'Inside Ulster' was broadcast from Belfast's new 'state of the art' Studio B. This programme began to take advantage of the new breaks through in TV technology using techniques that would have seemed the wildest science fiction in the days of 'Studio Eight' BBC Newsline's first programme was on 12th February, 1996.

Battlestars|1981|"Battlestars" was a spin-off of Merrill-Heatter Productions' verenable "The Hollywood Squares." However, "Battlestars" had quite different rules. Two contestants, including a champion, competed; the six celebrities, all whom appeared a week at a time, sat in a two-tiered row of triangles, with the numbers 1 through 10 lighted at each of the triangle's corner angles. Each contestant used a plunger to stop a randomly flashing light; wherever the light stopped, that celebrity played (unless the light touched more than one triangle, in which case the contestant chose a celebrity). Host Trebek asked the celebrity a question, to which he or she would answer. The contestant had to decide whether to agree or disagree with the celebrity's answer. If correct, the contestant retained control, but if not, control passed to his/her opponent; either way, the number was lit. The player who lit the third number around a celebrity "captured" that star, with the background turning either blue (for the champion) or red (for the challenger). Slightly different rules were played if two (or sometimes, three) celebrities could be captured on a single question. The first player to capture three celebrities won $500 and played the Picture Round. In the Picture Round, the champion was shown a famous face, with all but three of sixteen segments blacked out; if he/she could identify the face with just three segments showing, they won $5,000. If not, more squares could be revealed (and celebrity help enlisted) at $1,000 each. After six months, the original "Battlestars" left the air, only to return again in 1983 as "The New Battlestars." In "The New Battlestars," the front game's rules were similar, except that once a contestant lit a number, he/she could choose their own numbers until they guessed incorrectly. Also, the celebrity's answer choices were shown to the audience but not the contestant. The completely retooled bonus game was called Battlestar Bonanza, with the champion playing with the three celebrities he/she captured in the front game. In the Battlestar Bonanza, the contestant was asked a series of three questions as per the front game, each celebrity having one question apiece. The celebrities had three answer choices; if the contestant disagreed, they had to choose what they believed was the correct answer from the remaining two choices. Correct answers were worth $500 each, with all three correct answers worth $10,000 in cash and prizes, plus $2,500 added for each day the Battlestar Bonanza was not won. Contestants competed until defeated or winning five games (at which point they also won a new car).

Bauen auf Vergangenheit|2006|It has become a debated symbol of the city, right in the heart of Berlin: I.M. Pei's modern addition to the Royal Arsenal building, the "KËnigliche Zeughaus", houses the "Deutsche Historische Museum/German Historical Museum". This is an example of a Chinese-American architect building on "Prussian" history. This film is made up of fascinating and impressive images telling the story of a building that was once the royal arsenal, then the Prussian hall of honor, the East German Museum of national history and now the German Historical Museum. Two buildings represent two different epochs, two contrasting stories that are presented in a thrilling manner.... Diagonally opposite the Berlin City Palace on the "Unter den Linden" boulevard, a pompous baroque building was erected at great expense in 1695: the Armoury. It was used exclusively as the imperial weapons arsenal and was designed to make sure everybody noticed how big it was. In spite of all its ornamentation the building appeared too modern to many critics of the day, who claimed that it did not fit in to the cityscape. This film by Jeremy J.P. Fekete in the ARTE series "Building on the Past" illustrates the phenomenon by with the successful symbiosis of the armory and the Pei building.

The guest then has to sing a song (any song he/she wants) with that word in it. As more numbers are displayed, the phrase hidden behind the numbers eventually becomes obvious, and the point is won when they sing the song with that phrase. Other rounds involve guessing songs the band plays, then there's a freestyle round at the end where the artists run up to the stage as soon as they recognize a song.

Examples of the often-messy stunts (the centerpiece of the show) included blowing a plastic ship carrying a ping-pong ball from one side of a water-filled tub to the other, without allowing the ball to fall off; stuffing eight balloons in a lidded wastebasket without breaking any; and extracting three marshmallows buried in Jell-O using a spoon held in his mouth, then placing each marshmallow on a plate next to them. A huge clock counted down the seconds, as host Collyer provided commentary and encouragement. Couples who successfully completed their stunt won cash (usually $100 to $200, depending on the round) and a prize. After the first round of stunts, each couple got a chance to complete an extra-difficult "bonus stunt" (e.g., blowing a feather off a table and then catching it with a top hat while it was being worn) worth $100 plus $100 for each show it was not completed. During the big-money quiz-show era, the bonus prize stunt was worth $5,000 plus $1,000 for each show not completed.

Before the Big Bang V|2017|In this film Stephen Hawking, James Hartle and Thomas Hertog explain their model of the early universe: The No Boundary Proposal. In the 1960's and 70's Hawking and Penrose showed that according to classical general relativity, given some minimal assumptions the origin of an expanding universe is a singularity: a point of infinite density and spacetime curvature. But this and other singularity theorems do not take into account the strange world of quantum mechanics. So in the 1980's Hawking and collaborators started to build a model of the big bang that included quantum effects.The result is the No Boundary Proposal, a model that may be able to explain some of the deepest mysteries of the cosmos such as, is there a multiverse? how is there an arrow of time and what really happened a the big bang? This is the fifth in a series of films exploring competing models of the early universe. In my doctoral thesis I showed that, according to Einstein's theory of relativity, the universe must have had a beginning. But the theory of relativity did not say how the universe had begun. Since then, a key focus of my research has been to better understand the origin of the universe. I am pleased to present a new film which explains the model I developed over the years, initially with James Hartle and then later with Thomas Hertog and others. In "Before the Big Bang 5: The No Boundary Proposal", Jim, Thomas and I guide you through our No Boundary Proposal for the quantum origin of the universe and reveal how it can explain some of the universe's deepest mysteries. The film is free to view and part of a series developed by Youtuber skydivephil to explore competing models of the early universe. We hope you share and enjoy.

Black Women Don't Deserve to Be Loved|2012|A recent investigation by Yale University (2010) stated among other facts that 42% of black women in the United States had never been married compared to their Caucasian counterparts at 23%. This shocking investigation has caught the attention of media powerhouses such as ABC's Nightline, Focus Features Studios, and MSNBC. Although the statistic has been quoted through various outlets, the story of these women and the men that love them had never been addressed; it had yet to be told. It was then that I began to interview these women and the men that had once loved these black women. What were their stories? The various interviews I was able to tell the depictions, so that other black women can relate and see. The stories provided in both the novel and subsequent web-series, "Black Women Don't Deserve to be Loved", can help create dialogue between our black women, men and families. If this book can make us take a hard look at ourselves, our friends, our family members, co-workers and allow us to reflect on the issues we have faced in our relationships, than it has completed its mission. It is my hope that by speaking out and letting our sisters know that you are not alone, we can begin to heal and once and for all end the misconception perpetuated that Black Women Don't Deserve to be Loved.

Round 2 was played identically, with the contestant members of the team pantomiming the clues and the celebrities trying to decipher the puzzles; correct guesses were now worth $250.

The contestant could multiply his/her winnings by 10 by guessing three additional words or phrases within 20 seconds (e.g., if the contestant won $600 in the first half, he/she would play for $6,000); up to $10,000 was possible.

Borgia|2011|It was the age of Da Vinci and Michelangelo, of enlightened creativity and unparalleled intellectual achievement. But it was also the age of Machievelli, of rampant lawlessness, incessant war and unspeakable depravity. At the heart of the world order was the Vatican, the arbiter of conflicts between kingdoms and empires. And at the center of the Vatican was a man whose quest for power would propel him to seek the ultimate prize, the holy see of Rome. He was a man whose name would become synonymous with ruthlessness, and whose reign as pope would be remembered as the most infamous chapter of the history of the Catholic church -Rodrigo Borgia. His four children -Juan, the oldest, a prideful, lazy, unscrupulous sexual predator, Cesare, a young man torn between a faith that was not his calling and his dark violent nature, Lucretia, a young girl discovering the secret power that a women's sexuality holds, and Goffredo, an innocent child who would come of age in a family riven by conflict- would provide Rodrigo with a challenge as great as the political maneuvering of his political and religious rivals.

Bottle Boys|1984|Star of the oh-so-British series of saucy Confessions movies, 'Robin Askwith' (qv), was the leading man in Bottle Boys, portraying an accident-prone, football-mad milkman doing the rounds for Dawson Diaries, based in south London. His fellow milkmen were blokish and berkish - among them Jock the boozy Scotsman, teddy-boy Billy Watson and Joe the obligatory black, while Stan was the Welsh-born depot manager and Sharon his big-boobed, unable-to-type secretary. The series was predictably high on low-brow humour and slapstick, but, while his impish grin was much in evidence, viewers were at least spared the famed Askwith derriere that had loomed so large and so often on British cinema screens in the 1970s. They were, however, treated to the sight of the actor sporting chicken and cow costumes (don't ask) and performing such dangerous stunts as clinging from a sixth-floor parapet and meeting Mrs Thatcher (not the real one, of course). It is with a certain degree of relief that one notes that, reputedly, Bottle Boys was despised within ITV circles and its lack of political correctness was the last straw for certain of its comedy executives. ITV sitcoms had often plumbed the depths, but this was the limit.

Bourbon Whiz|2013|Millions have experienced the timeless tale of THE WIZARD OF OZ, either through the original book by L. Frank Baum, or the classic 1939 film starring Judy Garland. Yet, the new web series, BOURBON WHIZ, offers a modern, more adult take on the childhood favorite. The show stars Marisa Welles as Dotty, a young girl who lives in Prudence, Kansas, a small town where alcohol is sold every day - except Sundays, due to dry county laws. Longing for a stiff drink, not to mention excitement, she and her friends wind up on a wild journey to New Orleans. There, she meets some twisted variations on The Cowardly Lion, The Tin Man, and The Scarecrow. Together, they team up to battle the Wicked Stripper Of The West Bank (played by Jacqueline Fleming) and in search of the mysterious and magical Bourbon Whiz. Leduc describes BOURBON WHIZ as a collision of musical theatre and Bourbon Street. There are many similarities between BOURBON WHIZ and the original WIZARD OF OZ, but the differences are evident. "There's a ruby red G-string instead of ruby slippers, she meets a crackhead who's lost his crack (Palmintier), and a living statue who's looking for motivation (Deejay Buras), and a barker who's looking for a three-for-one sign (played by Leduc), so they end up going to see Bourbon Whiz," says Leduc. Along with original songs, the show also has parodies of the classic songs from the original WIZARD OF OZ. The songs are performed in various styles, from rock to country, blues to techno. BOURBON WHIZ is a show with a lot of 'in your face' sexual humor, one that provides viewers with a uniquely adult twist on a story we've all grown up with.

It presents those influential players both on stage and behind the scenes, as well as a variety of influential Broadway shows, a handful which are known to have transformed the musical into what the audience knows it to be today. The Broadway musical was often a reflection of what was happening in the world, but almost as often was meant to be an escape from problems of the world. Specific world events had a profound influence on the overall tone of Broadway shows, some of these events being wars (especially the world wars), Prohibition, the stock market crash, the Great Depression, and 9/11. Broadway musicals were also affected by the onset on various new media, such as talking movies and television. They in turn influenced other popular culture, especially what was known as the popular music of the day, especially up until the 1960s. Broadway musicals ultimately would become global commodities with many shows beginning their life elsewhere besides New York, and with many Broadway shows brought to the world stages through touring companies, regional productions and amateur productions.

By Way of the Stars|1992|Spring, 1865. The last spring in the childhood of Lukas Bienmann. Nothing forebodes the calamities about to befall the 13-year-old boy and his family in the peaceful town of Liebenberg, Prussia. Nature awakens to new life, and Lukas is happy, for his mother is about to give birth to her second child, and Lukas' grandfather, Brunneck, is coming from Canada for the event. Brunneck, however, brings only discord to the family. Though Lukas is excited by his grandfather's plans to take the family back with him to Canada, his father Karl will hear none of this. Tempers flare and Lukas' mother, deeply troubled and frightened, goes into early labor - and dies. Brunneck blames Karl, and demands to take Lukas with him. Bewildered, Lukas flees into the night. Lukas accidentally witnesses an altercation between a local nobleman, Count Otto von Lebrecht, and a gambling partner to whom he owes money. When Otto kills the man in a rage, Lukas tries to flee, but is caught by the murderer. Otto threatens to kill him and his father should he ever talk... Otto, who has stolen some valuable jewels, lays the blame on Lukas' father Karl. Fearful of Otto's threats, Lukas is unable to defend his father, even though he knows that Otto committed the theft. After Karl is sent to jail, Lukas is taken into the home of the benevolent Baron von Knabig. The Baron places the boy in the custody of his wife's brother - who turns out to be none other than Otto von Lebrecht! Though Lukas' future looks bleak, he soon wins the confidence of the Baron and his wife: one day, Al-Jamil, the magnificent stallion the Baron has bought for his daughter Ursula, is whipped into a panic by Count Otto. Lukas leaps into the paddock to calm the animal and prevent it from injuring anyone. Impressed, the Baron entrusts Al-Jamil to the boy's care. Though Ursula, fifteen, is not allowed to ride Al-Jamil yet, she disobeys her father and is nearly trampled by the frisky stallion. Lukas rescues her, and is rewarded by being allowed to visit his father in prison. Otto, however, foils the meeting, just as he has been preventing the Baroness' letters from reaching Brunneck in Canada, ensuring that the boy's grandfather cannot come to his aid. Unable to pawn the stolen jewels, Otto plots to kidnap and sell Al-Jamil, and to dispose of Lukas in the process. Otto puts a wrench in his own plans, however, for he causes an accident in which the horse is seriously injured. The Baron wants to have the horse killed, but Lukas begs him to let him nurse Al-Jamil to health. Ursula, won over by Lukas' energetic nature, finally brings her father to yield. Al-Jamil's recovery helps seal Lukas' friendship with Ursula. As Otto's threats become more menacing, Lukas plans a daring escape for himself and his father. To this effect, he enlists the help of an old peddlar and trusted friend, Nathan. Though they succeed in freeing Karl from prison, the operation runs into a snag when Otto's henchmen capture Lukas. While Karl heads off to America alone, Lukas frees himself and gallops to Danzig on Al-Jamil. He sneaks onto a ship headed for America, hoping to find his father there. Little does he know who else is on board: Ursula, the Baroness - and Count Otto. Lukas is discovered and faces punishment as a stowaway. Sensing that the boy is troubled, the Baroness takes him aside. Lukas pours out his heart and reveals the truth about Otto... Determined to clear Karl's name and save Lukas from punishment, the Baroness confronts Otto, who confesses. Before she can bring the truth to light, however, tragedy strikes: smallpox breaks out among the passengers, and she succumbs to the disease while caring for the sick. Meanwhile, Karl arrives in the American South, where he is hired by a northern lumber company to take a shipment of wood north. He and his companions Virgil and six-year-old Tomorrow, ex-slaves, are being followed by Tully, a Southerner bent on destroying the lumber dealer. One night, Tully sets fire to the depot where Karl and the others are sleeping. A fight ensues, and Tully is engulfed by the flames. Karl tries to save Tomorrow, but is too late: the boy dies in his arms. Shattered by her mother's death, Ursula resolves to help Lukas now that she knows about her uncle's murderous past. As the ship anchors in New York, the children violate the quarantine and jump ship, with Otto fast behind them. They elude Otto, but fall into the hands of two con men, who take them to Lower Canada, where they plan to ransom Ursula and kill Lukas. But Lukas discovers their plan, frees Ursula, and they escape down river in a canoe. Their troubles are far from over, however, for the quiet, tranquil river soon gives way to churning, foaming rapids. The children lose control of the canoe, which overturns, submerging them. Lukas dives after Ursula, pulls her to the surface, and drags her to the shore. Exhausted after their ordeal, the youngsters now find themselves alone on land best avoided by white people: Indian territory. Lost in the wilderness, Lukas and Ursula decide to head for Brunneck's house in Niagara. But disaster strikes again when a bear attacks and mauls Lukas. Ursula's screams alert some nearby Indians, who shoot the bear as it is about to kill Lukas. The children are taken to the Indians' camp, where Lukas comes under the care of a medicine man. Karl makes it to Niagara, where he begs his father-in-law to send for Lukas. Brunneck agrees, however, only on the condition that he be given responsibility for Lukas' upbringing. With his son's well-being at heart, Karl accepts Brunneck's terms and leaves. But when Brunneck learns the children's whereabouts and Lukas arrives in Niagara, Brunneck tells him that his father has left him in his care, implying that Karl no longer wants him... Thunderstruck, Lukas turns his back on Brunneck. He and Ursula set out by rail for the West. The train nearly turns into a death trap, however, when they run into Otto. With their lives at stake, they jump from the train and continue their journey on foot. The weary pair is picked up by a wagon train, and befriended by Renauld and FranÃoise Broissard. Ursula, meanwhile, catches the eye of a good-looking railroad surveyor named Ben. Lukas and Ursula soon realize how dangerous pioneer life can be when a messenger warns them of approaching hostile Sioux warriors. Fearing the worst, FranÃoise sends a message to Brunneck. Lukas believes that he can talk sense into the Indians and, disobeying Ben's orders, impulsively sets off on horseback to find them. Ben catches Lukas and berates him, but their argument comes to a sudden end when the Sioux appear on a nearby ridge... Blood-curdling cries announce the Sioux' charge. When Ben is injured, Lukas grabs his fallen comrade's weapon and joins actively in the skirmish. His enthusiasm for the battle vanishes, however, when he suddenly faces a knife-wielding Sioux youth and kills the boy in self-defense. The settlers manage to drive away the Indians, but Lukas cannot overcome the shock of having taken a person's life. Brunneck, who has gotten FranÃoise's message, swallows his pride and asks Karl to go look for the children with him. A short time later, Baron von Knabig also arrives in Niagara and sets out for Fort Garry as well. At Fort Garry, Lukas is moved by the plight of a pregnant young Cree woman, White Feather, who is being mistreated by her white husband Sam. Unable to take the life-threatening abuse of the young woman any longer, Lukas decides to smuggle her out of the fort and back to her tribe. Though Ursula tries to talk him out of it, nothing can deter him. The escape goes like clockwork. But just before the pair can reach the Cree camp, the girl goes into labor, giving birth to a baby boy. Suddenly, Sam appears, filled with a murderous desire for revenge. Fortunately, a Cree hunting party disarms him. Though White Feather is saved, Lukas makes an unpleasant discovery: the Cree are accompanied by two Sioux warriors who attacked the wagon train - and who also recognize Lukas... Lukas is brought to the Cree camp, where the Sioux demand his life. But the Cree Chief, grateful to the boy for having saved White Feather, gives Lukas a pony and orders Black Hawk to escort him to Fort Garry. On the way, Black Hawk forces Lukas into a perilous race. But when the boy holds his own, a bond begins to develop between the two - a bond which is cemented when Lukas saves his companion's life in an Indian attack. Brunneck and Karl have been robbed by a trapper and abandoned in the wilderness. When a wildfire breaks out, the two men finally reconcile their differences and fight to save their lives. Close to exhaustion, they are saved by none other than Baron von Knabig and a wagon train headed for Fort Garry. The Baron is reunited with Ursula, but his companions set off with Black Hawk, who was forced to leave his friend Lukas behind in the Indian attack. Count Otto is also out West. He has taken on the identity of Clayton Pyle, who was on his way to claim half a gold mine he inherited with an aunt he never met. The injured Lukas comes across the prospector Annie Pyle, who takes him to her gold mine. Lukas' blood freezes when he meets "Clayton". Otto shoots, causing a cave-in, from which they barely manage to escape. Undaunted, Otto again goes after Lukas and tries to drown him, but just before he can do so, Black Hawk comes galloping to the rescue and kills him. Ursula, who is in love with Ben, is afraid that her father will take her back to Prussia. But the Baron, much to her surprise, agrees to cancel the marriage he had planned for her and gives the couple his blessing. Karl and Brunneck are overwhelmed with joy when they spot Lukas approaching with Black Hawk. After so many trials and tribulations, the family is finally reunited once again.

From round to round one contestant could kick out an other contestant, so the team gets smaller and the possible prize grows for the contestants left in the team. 
Ca$h Cab|2005|The player keeps answering questions trying not to get any wrong. If they get three incorrect answers, then the cab pulls over and they are dropped off wherever they are. They lose any money they would have won. The first four questions are worth $25 each, the next four questions are worth $50, and any question thereafter are worth $100. If a contestant has won more than $200 and the cab is forced to stop at a traffic light, the driver will start a Red Light Challenge. The driver will read a question that has multiple correct answers (usually five or more), and the passenger will then have 30 seconds to give a designated number of those answers (usually all five). Doing so is worth an additional $250 to the fare, and failure to answer the question will not count as a strike, so there is no risk. The passenger is allowed two "Shout-Outs" during the course of the trip, and each type can be used only once. The first type is the Mobile Shout-Out, in which the contestant is allotted a phone call to a friend by means of the driver's cell phone. The player is allowed to ask their friend the question and acquire what they think is the correct answer, however, there is a 30 second time limit. The other is the Street Shout-Out. If the passenger chooses to use this one, the driver will stop at the first person he sees and will let the fare ask the person the question and what they think the correct answer is, but there is no time limit for this question. Although there is no time limit, often times the pedestrian does not know the answer. Should the passenger reach the destination, the driver offers the passenger a choice. The passenger has the option of keeping the prize money and leaving the cab, or the choice of answering a final, more difficult, visual question that, if answered correctly, doubles the fare's winnings. However, if the passenger chooses to answer the final question and provides an incorrect answer, the game show host keeps all the money the passenger won previously. Three games are usually played per episode.

Years of excruciating poverty have not been lost on three-time chairwoman Mary Ann Andreas of the Morongo tribe, whose reservation is near Palm Springs. She remembers the dirt floor shack of her childhood, and the impossibility of dreaming for the wealth the tribe now holds. For Viejas tribal Chairman Anthony Pico, the abundance of today harks back to the times before contact with Europeans.

Capitalism|2014|In the early days of the system, that came to be known as Capitalism, political economists of all stripes struggled to understand the laws that govern the flow of capital - and of Capitalism's related activities.

But in recent times, as the system, and the world, has grown a hundredfold more complex we have veered away from the pursuit of any clear, critical understanding of the phenomenon. Economic departments in most major universities in the English-speaking world have abolished courses in the history of Economic and political economy. We are left with incomprehensible mathematical models whose relevance to the real world is hotly disputed. We were told very little about Adam Smith, David Ricardo and Thomas Malthus yet their names have been used to give legitimacy to contemporary economic activities. To further obscure the issues, this Â´ econo speak Âª has been supplemented by endless superficial news reports, pundits discussions and analysis filled with clichÃs and superficial information. Our series intends to puncture this veil of opacity to go beyond the current Â´ econo- speak Âª to re examine the ideas which have been used in the past 40 to reshape the world. Is today's economic crisis a temporary blimp on the road to progress or a symptom of a deeper crisis of the system as a whole? Can the big ideas of the at the heart of our Economic system help us understand today's economic crisis, or obscure it? And more importantly - can they show us a way out? Where does capitalism come from? Did it evolve through the normal course of our societies or was it born from theories elaborated by political changes and technologies? This 6 part series is an in-depth investigation shot in over 22 countries that challenges the fathers of capitalism and the established ideas and principles of the system.

Card Sharks|1978|In 1978 NBC debuted "Card Sharks" and it features two(2) contestants, one(1) a champion competed. The host read a question asked of 100 people in a certain group (e.g., mothers-to-be, homecoming queens & Congressmen). The questions could be serious, funny, cute ... but were always interesting. The 1st contestant had to predict how many of those 100 people answered a certain way, while his or her opponent had to guess whether the actual figure was higher or lower. The contestant who was correct played a card game based on Acey-Deucey; he or she was shown their base card (they could play it or change it) and had to guess whether the next card was higher or lower than the previous one(1) card. {The Playing Cards ranked from Ace(High) to 2(Low)}. Any incorrect judgment (miscall or mistake) or a duplicate card had the overturned cards except the base card discarded and allowed the opponent a chance at his/her row of cards (no change of the base card allowed); players could "freeze" at any point to keep their opponent away from their cards or to gain an advantageous position. Up to four questions were played per game, with the 4th and final question called "sudden death." One game to complete all 5 cards calling Higher or Lower wins $100 and be the first(1st) player to win two(2) games collects $200 played the Big Money Cards; if a third (3rd) game was required, a "Sudden Death" round with 3 cards and a maximum of 3 questions was played. In the Big Money Cards, the champion used an initial purse of $200 to bet on a series of seven cards (positioned on a three(3) row board, with an extra $200 ($400 in 1986-1989) given after play of the third card); originally, the base card on only the first row could be changed, but this was later changed to changing the base card on each row; correct guesses earned the player their bet, while wrong guesses or a duplicate card lost the bet. Starting in October 1980, the contestant did not lose money if the exact card came up. The final card, if they didn't "BUST" (i.e. lost everything) on the second row was the "Big Bet," where the contestant had to bet at least half(1/2) of his/her cash. Up to $28,800 was possible. Champions continued until defeated or until winning seven(7) games. The Game Play was largely similar in the 1986 CBS/syndicated revival with the following changes: 1. Questions could also involve "educated guesses" or general knowledge questions with numerical answers and a special 10-member polling group seated in the audience who played for the entire week. 2. In 1988, the tiebreaker game was changed to one sudden death question. 3. One card on each row in the Big Money Cards could be changed. 4. In October 1986, after the Big Money Cards (for a chance up to $32,000), players could use any jokers found in the deck to help them win a new car with the help of 7 numbered cards (1 "CAR" & 6 "No" Cards); In July 1988, this was changed to a question read about the 10-member polling group, with a player winning the car for guessing the number exactly by moving a blue diamond shaped marker to place the number from 0 to 10. The player could win an extra $500 if they were one away from the correct number. The Show changed from 7 wins to 5 wins on CBS-TV & Syndicated.

Carlos Gardel the King of Tango|2017|The qualities which gave Gardel his great success are naturally somewhat difficult to recapture in their fullness. First and foremost, of course, the zorzal, as his endearing nickname implies, was a superb popular singer. We can still hear the voice, preserved on admittedly imperfect recordings. And it is a fine, rich, resonant voice, making up in expressiveness what it lacks in power. 'That man,' said an American film director hearing Gardel for the first time, 'that man has a tear in his throat.' Gardel's sensitivity to the essence of the songs he sang was unusually acute. The 900 or so recorded songs which form the much-loved Gardel canon display an extraordinary range of feeling lyricism, melancholy, chirpiness, sarcasm, high spirits, wistfulness, nostalgia, and even occasional ferocity. Gardel had a natural sense of rhythm which proved particularly appropriate for tango singing. He worked very hard at his music, and also at creating the kind of 'image' he felt to be the necessary accompaniment to stardom. His grooming was impeccable. The smoothly plastered hair, the elegant three-piece suits, the carefully chosen ties, the perfectly polished shoes he looked every inch the successful star, every inch the smart porteno who had come out on top. His lifelong tendency to corpulence was zealously combated by strenuous exercise in Buenos Aires he frequented the YMCA gymnasium combined with massage and Turkish baths. These punishing routines kept him in excellent physical condition.
